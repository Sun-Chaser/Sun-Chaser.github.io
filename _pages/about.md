Hi — I’m **Honghao Yang (杨洪浩)**, and I also go by **Jack**. I’m a **junior at Washington University in St. Louis**, majoring in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Statistics**.

I’m interested in **high-performance computing (HPC)** and **GPU programming**, especially **performance debugging**:
- **Profiling bottlenecks**
- **Fixing correctness issues**
- **Making code faster** without turning it into a mess

On this site, I share **projects**, **notes**, and **experiments** as I learn more about **parallel systems** and **performance engineering**.
