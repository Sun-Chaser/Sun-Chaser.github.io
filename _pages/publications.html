<div class="about_publication">
  I‘m lucky to collaborate with excellent researchers who take on tough high-performance computing challenges. I appreciate the mentorship and guidance from my collaborators and advisors throughout the research process.
  I like the team workflow of designing experiments, profiling bottlenecks, debugging correctness issues, and iterating until the system is both fast and trustworthy, especially for real-time and streaming workloads.
  In the future, I hope to explore more interdisciplinary applications of high-performance computing, such as scientific simulations and machine learning.
  If you are interested in working together, please feel free to <a href="mailto:honghao@wustl.edu">reach out</a>!
