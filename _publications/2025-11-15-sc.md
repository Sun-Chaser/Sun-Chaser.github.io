## Abstract

Multi-wavelength observation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) requires real-time interaction among multiple telescopes. A gamma-ray telescope detects and localizes a GRB in the sky and must then communicate with an optical telescope to direct the latter toward the GRB as quickly as possible. We previously developed software for ADAPT, a suborbital gamma-ray telescope, to localize GRBs in real time, on a timescale shorter than that of the GRB itself. This work therefore studies progressive localization, in which ADAPT computes a series of increasingly accurate location estimates during a GRB to enable a partner instrument to more rapidly find it. We describe a modeling and optimization framework to decide when ADAPT should compute estimated GRB locations to minimize the time for the partner to find the GRB. Our framework can design progressive strategies that allow a partner telescope to find a GRB up to 42% faster than strategies using a single alert.
