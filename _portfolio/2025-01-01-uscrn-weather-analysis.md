Highlights:

- Cleaned daily observations from 132 stations; handled missing-value codes and built exploratory visualizations.
- Fit site-specific harmonic regression with annual/semiannual terms to model seasonality.
- Derived per-site trend slopes and climate features (amplitude, warmest/coldest day, variability).
- Mapped spatial patterns, finding a small positive overall warming trend and larger variability inland.
