Highlights:

- Designed a Next.js + FastAPI workflow for dataset upload, model selection, and job submission.
- Generated RayJob configs dynamically and launched distributed workloads on a KubeRay-managed Ray cluster on GKE.
- Integrated GCS for artifacts (models, metrics, predictions) and added Prometheus + Grafana + Ray Dashboard monitoring.
- Implemented secure cloud access (Kubernetes service accounts/IAM) and load-balanced dashboard access for remote execution.
