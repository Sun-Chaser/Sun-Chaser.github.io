Highlights:

- Investigated Intel oneTBB for streaming pipeline simulation and parallel execution strategies.
- Benchmarked pipeline stages using Google Benchmark, Nanobenchmark, and custom C++ timing tools.
- Analyzed latency distributions to characterize variability and tail behavior.
- Identified and resolved performance bottlenecks in parallel/concurrent code paths.
- Rebuilding the localization stage in CUDA for the new GPU architecture of ADAPT (current project).
