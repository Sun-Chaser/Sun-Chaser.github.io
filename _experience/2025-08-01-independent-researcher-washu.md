Highlights:

- Studied advanced topics in U-statistics and bootstrap resampling.
- Explored network generative models (k-NN graphs, Erdos-Renyi, random geometric graphs) with a focus on structural properties.
- Analyzed asymptotic behavior via triangle counts in sparse regimes.
- Defined a project on fixed-k k-NN graphs, focusing on limiting behavior and graph statistics (current project).
